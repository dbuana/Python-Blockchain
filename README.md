# Davian's Wallet; In our virtual-waller we trust!
Davian's Wallet is a cryptocurrency, or virtual currency; created by Davian Buana. Blockchains were a major contributor to this project, after learning the concept; meaning it will not be as sophisticated but, the project will progress. Also, this project was inspired by BitCoin; a famous virtual-currency.
